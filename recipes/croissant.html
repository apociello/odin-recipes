    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This flat croissant with Nutella and berries is as delicious as a tart. A deliciously pan-toasted croissant, warm, spread with Nutella, and topped with fresh berries, can be a snack, a sumptuous breakfast, or even dessert.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large croissant</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chocolate hazelnut spread (such as NutellaÂ®)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh berries, such as sliced strawberries, blueberries or raspberries</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a rolling pin or hands to flatten the croissant to 1/4-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Heat butter a medium skillet over medium heat until melted. Place croissant in skillet, bottom side down, and press firmly with bottom of a smaller skillet or saucepan until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.  Drizzle honey evenly over croissant and add remaining butter to skillet. Flip croissant over and press again, cooking until the top side is lightly browned and toasted, about 2 minutes. Remove to a plate to cool. </li>

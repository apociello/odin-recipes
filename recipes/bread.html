    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cottage cheese bread is a simple bread with a neutral flavor like regular white bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup warm water  (105 to 115 degrees F or 41 to 46 degrees C)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup egg whites or 6 to 7 egg whites</li>
        <li>3/4 cup whole milk cottage cheese </li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Combine warm water and yeast in a large bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine the egg whites and cottage cheese in a blender or food processor. Cover and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add cottage cheese mixture to the yeast mixture and whisk to combine. </li>
        <li>Using a wooden spoon, stir flour and salt into the wet mixture until combined (dough will be sticky). </li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead about 5 minutes or until smooth but still slightly tacky, adding additional flour as needed.</li>
        <li>Shape dough into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Line a 9x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Punch dough down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently pat and pinch dough into a loaf shape, tucking edges underneath.</li>
        <li>Place shaped dough, seam side down, in prepared loaf pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly double in size (about 30 minutes).</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Using a sharp knife, cut a shallow slit, lengthwise, down the middle of the loaf. </li>
        <li>Bake until bread sounds hollow when lightly tapped, 40 to 45 minutes. Cover loosely with foil for the last 10 to 15 minutes to prevent overbrowning.</li>
        <li>Immediately remove from pan and cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
